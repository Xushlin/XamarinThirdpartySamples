NDCTodo
=======

This code was presented at the [Norwegian Developers Conference](http://www.ndcoslo.com/) in Oslo, June 2013 during the two introductory sessions on building iOS and Android apps using Xamarin.

This simple 'to do list' app uses about 100 lines of code to demonstrate how C# can be used to target the iOS and Android platforms.
