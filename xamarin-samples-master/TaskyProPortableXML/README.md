TaskyPortableXML
================


[UPDATED CODE available in the NDCPortable sample](https://github.com/conceptdev/xamarin-samples/tree/master/NDCPortable)



DEPRECATED NOTES
----------------

This simple to-do list app demonstrates using a **Portable Class Library** to share code between Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android and Windows apps.

To keep the code simple we use a single XML file as the data-store - it contains a serialized collection of Task objects that we read & write to when the user edits their to-do items.

There are two implementations of the Portable code:

* C#
* [Visual Basic](https://gist.github.com/conceptdev/bba20899cf8901cc36a2)!

Because Portable Class Library profiles do not allow `System.IO` we expose an interface in the shared code that we implement in our apps (`IXmlStorage`). Thanks to the magic of .NET the two language implementations are interchangeable and application code 'just works' whichever PCL you reference.

If you are browsing the VB code, this 
[Visual Basic Reference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sh9ywfdk.aspx) might come in handy ;)
