==============

iOS, Android and Windows Phone apps that use a Shared Project to share code.

**Shared Projects** were introduced in Visual Studio 2013 and Xamarin Studio.

They provide a much neater solution than file-linking for sharing C# source files across multiple projects, allowing the use of `#if` compiler directives to include platform-specific code where required.
