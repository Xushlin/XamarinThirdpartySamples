Xamarin.CircleImageCropper
==========================


<p>This project it the Xamarin.Android implementation of <a href='https://github.com/rachitwatts/CircleImageCropper'>CircleImageCropper.</a>

<p>The CircleImageCropper is an image cropping tool for Circle Image View used by several applications these days. 
It provides a way to set an image in XML and programmatically, and displays a resizable circular crop window on top of the image. 
Calling the method getCroppedCircleImage() will then return the Circle Bitmap marked by the circular crop window.</p>

<p>Developers can customize the following attributes (both via XML and programmatically):</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>appearance of guidelines in the crop window</li>
<li>image resource</li>
</ul><p>A public method to rotate the image by a specified number of degrees is also included. This can be used to provide the user with an option to fix the image orientation should Android miscalculate the intended orientation.</p>

<p>Supported on API Level 7 and above.</p>
