Download and extract javadoc from the jar into a sub-folder.
Include in git, but not in the project.
This is used for correct naming of parameters as described in the following link:
http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/advanced_topics/java_integration_overview/binding_a_java_library_(.jar)/naming_parameters_with_javadoc/
If the javadocs are in Java7 format, then the tag should be Java7DocPaths instead of JavaDocPaths as described here:
